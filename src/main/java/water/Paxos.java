/**
 * Paxos
 *
 * Used to define Cloud membership.  See:
 *   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_%28computer_science%29
 *
 * This Paxos implementation communicates via combination of multi-cast on the
 * local subnet and point-to-point.  Multi-cast is used to announce the
 * existence of *this* Cloud to any other Cloud in the subnet - which is
 * basically a Client request to all Servers to run a subnet-local round of
 * leadership and membership.  If all Servers who hears this request are
 * already in the same Cloud, then no action is required.
